# RP MODULES APP
RP MODULES APP

In todayâ€™s lesson, I learned the basic Intent commands and I applied it to this app.

- This app supposedly will automatically show all of a studentâ€™s modules information, module name, module code, module credit etc.

- Has a nice welcome screen with animation ( not as nice as my previous app)
- Home screen shows buttons (cardview) that contains the module name and module code.
- A student using this app would want to find out something about a specific module, and he/she will tap on one of the buttons.

- By doing so, it will lead them to the results page which shows all the information to the user based on the module that he/she has chosen to check out.
- Added a back home button to lead them back to the Home screen.

- Was hesitant to add the classic back-arrow imagebutton because it is displeasing to me, thus I used a normal button instead.
- Do not be fooled by the Module Credit, that is an imaginary number (hope this app can make me have an A for today's lesson ðŸ¥²)
